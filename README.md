# Load the extension

Extensions that you download from the Chrome Web Store are packaged up as .crx files, which is great for distribution, but not so great for development. Recognizing this, Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing. Let's do that now.

    1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
    2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
    3. Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
    4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
